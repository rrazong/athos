# Athos
Pre-interview Technical Exercise

1. See the file `athos-frontend-exercise.pdf` 
2. Instructions:
   * build the webpage from the pdf
   * for the video, use any video you want (or grab one off the athos homepage)
   * bonus points for being able to cycle thru multiple videos using the 'next/previous' controls seen in the mock
   
To install and open
* % git clone git@github.com:rrazony/athos.git
* And then open the local file `.../athos/index.html` in a browser.

Notes
* I did not get a chance to implement the next/previous controls.  However, I set up the markup to do it.
